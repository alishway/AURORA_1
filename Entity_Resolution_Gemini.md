## Relations Module: Search-Driven Entity Resolution for Law Enforcement

**Abstract:** The "Relations" module is designed to provide law enforcement personnel with a powerful search and entity resolution capability, enabling the identification and linking of disparate records pertaining to individuals, organizations, or assets. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent query interpretation and an advanced probabilistic entity resolution pipeline, the module aims to transform raw, free-form search queries into actionable insights, presenting consolidated entity profiles and illuminating hidden relationships.

### 1\. Introduction: Bridging Search and Entity Resolution

The core challenge in law enforcement data analysis is the fragmentation of information across numerous, often siloed, data sources. Traditional keyword-based search systems struggle with the inherent noise, inconsistency, and varying formats of real-world data. The "Relations" module addresses this by integrating a sophisticated search front-end with a robust Entity Resolution (ER) backend, allowing users to pose natural language queries and receive intelligently linked results.

The module operates on the principle that seemingly disparate records can often refer to the same underlying entity ("Who Is Who") or reveal indirect connections ("Who Knows Who"). Our approach combines:

  * **Intelligent Query Parsing (LLM-driven):** To extract structured attributes from unstructured text.
  * **Probabilistic Entity Resolution:** To identify and link records based on a combination of exact, partial, and fuzzy matches of identifying attributes.
  * **Graph-based Visualization:** To intuitively represent the discovered relationships.

-----

### 2\. The Search-Driven Entity Resolution Workflow

The "Relations" module orchestrates a multi-stage process, beginning with user input and culminating in a consolidated view of linked entities.

#### 2.1. Stage 1: Intuitive Query Formulation

The module initiates with a user-friendly search interface:

  * **Open Text Field:** Users can input free-form natural language queries (e.g., "I am looking for a woman, middle age possible email address katherine.j@hotmail.com, have a couple of phone numbers 613-615-4589, 1-909-948-4848, ... last seen was in Phoenix Arizona"). This allows for flexible and unconstrained input, mimicking natural investigative thought processes.

#### 2.2. Stage 2: LLM-Powered Query Extraction and Confirmation

Upon user input, a Large Language Model (LLM), augmented by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, performs the following:

  * **Attribute Extraction:** The LLM analyzes the free-form text to identify and extract key entity attributes (e.g., `sex`, `email`, `phone_numbers`, `city`, `state`, `address_components`, `vehicle_details`, `social_media_handles`).

  * **Data Cleaning and Normalization:** The LLM applies preliminary cleaning and normalization rules to extracted data (e.g., standardizing phone numbers by removing leading `+1` or extracting area codes, parsing addresses into `suite/unit`, `street_number`, `street_name`, `zipcode`). This step is crucial for improving downstream matching accuracy.

  * **User Confirmation:** The extracted and normalized attributes are presented to the user for confirmation. This feedback loop is vital for ensuring the LLM's interpretation aligns with the user's intent.

    **Example 1: Extracted Query Confirmation**

    ```
    Please confirm the search query:

    - sex: female
    - email: katherine.j (domains considered: any)
    - phone_numbers: ["613-615-4589", "909-948-4848"]
    - city: Phoenix
    - state: Arizona
    - address_hint: Phoenix, Arizona
    ```

    **Example 2: Extracted Query Confirmation**

    ```
    Please confirm the search query:

    - phone_numbers: ["903-484-8484"]
    - vehicle_license_plate: "Kilif 33"
    - address:
        - suite_unit: "55"
        - street_number: "90"
        - street_name: "Kilberne Street"
        - city: [auto-deduced or user-confirmed from context]
        - state_province: Ohio
        - zipcode_postal_code: "904221"
    - social_media_account: "Twitter: @xGeeky"
    ```

#### 2.3. Stage 3: User Interaction and Search Initiation

The user is presented with two options:

  * **Confirm Search:** Proceed with the extracted query.
  * **Edit Search Query:** Modify or refine the extracted attributes, allowing for manual correction or addition of details.

#### 2.4. Stage 4: Execution of Search and Entity Resolution Pipeline

Upon confirmation, the system initiates the core search and ER process. This involves iteratively applying the search algorithm across various data sources. For each retrieved record, the following metadata is provided:

  * **Data Source Name:** (e.g., "DMV Records," "Social Media Scrape," "Internal Case Management System")
  * **API Address (if applicable):** The specific endpoint from which the record was retrieved.
  * **Matching Accuracy Rate:** A confidence score indicating the likelihood of the record matching the search query.
  * **Contextual Information:** Any additional data that aids the user in evaluating the relevance of the record.

**Future Enhancements:**

  * **'Find Links to This Record':** Initiates a new search using the attributes of the selected record.
  * **'Save Record to Case':** Integrates the record into an ongoing investigation.
  * **'Show Links':** Visualizes the direct and indirect connections of the record.
  * **'Show Fraudulent Activities Linked to This Record':** Triggers a specialized search for suspicious patterns.

### 3\. The Probabilistic Entity Resolution Algorithm

Our ER algorithm is founded on the principle of probabilistic identification of entity signatures within diverse datasets, linking records that share common or similar characteristics. The process is divided into four well-established phases:

#### 3.1. Phase 1: Blocking (Indexing)

  * **Objective:** To reduce the quadratic complexity of record comparisons to a more manageable linear scale by creating "blocks" of records that are likely to refer to the same entity.
  * **Methodology:** Records are grouped into blocks based on shared attributes, which serve as "blocking keys." Examples of blocking keys include:
      * First few characters of a last name + approximate date of birth.
      * Normalized phone number (e.g., 10-digit numerical sequence).
      * Standardized street number and name prefix.
      * Email domain (though the ER matching will focus on the ID).
  * **Benefit:** Significantly reduces the number of pairwise comparisons required, making the ER process computationally feasible for large datasets.

#### 3.2. Phase 2: Block Processing (Canopy Clustering / Pruning)

  * **Objective:** To refine the blocks generated in Phase 1, minimizing redundant and unlikely comparisons.
  * **Methodology:** Techniques such as canopy clustering or sophisticated pruning strategies are applied within each block. This might involve:
      * Further sub-blocking based on additional attributes.
      * Discarding records that are too dissimilar even within the same block.
      * Prioritizing comparisons between records that share a high number of common blocking key values.
  * **Benefit:** Optimizes the comparison process, ensuring that only the most promising pairs are passed to the next phase.

#### 3.3. Phase 3: Entity Matching (Record Linkage)

  * **Objective:** To compare records within blocks and classify them as matches or non-matches based on similarity metrics. This is the core of the record linkage process.

  * **Methodology:**

      * **Feature Vector Generation:** For each pair of records being compared, a feature vector $\\mathbf{f}$ is constructed. This vector contains values representing the similarity of various attributes (e.g., Jaccard similarity for names, Levenshtein distance for addresses, exact match for phone numbers).
      * **Similarity Metrics:**
          * **Exact Match:** For unique identifiers like fully normalized phone numbers, email IDs (after domain stripping), and precise latitude/longitude coordinates. This contributes a high score.
          * **Fuzzy Matching (Tokenization and n-grams):** For attributes like names and addresses, which are prone to variations and typos.
              * **Name & Address Tokenization:** Convert names and addresses into bags of tokens. For addresses, use **bigram tokenization** (e.g., "SUITE 18 555 VPIN DR" becomes {"SUITE 18", "18 555", "555 VPIN", "VPIN DR"}). Bigrams are preferred for addresses as they preserve word order and offer robustness against minor variations.
              * **Jaccard Index ($J$):** A common similarity measure for sets of tokens. For two sets of tokens $A$ and $B$, $J(A, B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|}$.
              * **Enrichment for Unique Identifiers:** The overall similarity score is enriched by assigning higher weights or "points" to matches (exact or partial) involving unique identifiers (e.g., full address components, phone numbers, email IDs).
          * **Partial Matching:** A weighted combination of partial matches across multiple attributes. For example, a partial name match combined with a partial address match (focusing on `unit number`, `street number`, `street name`) contributes to a higher confidence score, especially if `city/country` or `zipcode` also align.
      * **Probabilistic Classification:** A classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, or a custom scoring function) is trained to predict the probability of a match, $P(\\text{Match} | \\mathbf{f})$, based on the feature vector. This model is trained on a labeled dataset of known matches and non-matches.

  * **Search Algorithm (Enhanced Smart Search):** This utilizes the ER methodology for dynamic search query execution.

    1.  **Exact Unique Identifier Match (High Score):** Prioritize records with exact matches on unique identifiers (e.g., full phone number, standardized address including unit/street number and zipcode).
    2.  **Combination of Partial Unique Identifier Matches (Weighted Score):** Evaluate combinations of partial matches across several unique identifiers. The more partial unique identifiers that align, the higher the match probability.
    3.  **Fuzzy n-gram Matching (Names and Addresses):** Apply bigram/n-gram tokenization and similarity measures (e.g., Jaccard index) for names and addresses where exact matches are unlikely or partial information is available. Crucially, when performing partial address matching, require at least a matching `city/country` or `zipcode` to narrow down results and maintain accuracy.

    **Example: John Doe Search**

      * **Search Query BagOfTokens ($S\_{QT}$):** {John, Doe, Suite 18, 18 555, 555 VPIN, VPIN DR}
      * **Matching Record BagOfTokens ($R\_{BT}$):** {J., Doe, VPIN DRIVE, DRIVE Suite, Suite 18}
      * **Common Tokens:** {Doe, Suite 18} (assuming "DR" and "DRIVE" are normalized or matched via a synonym list, and "VPIN" matches "VPIN").
      * **Jaccard Similarity:** $J(S\_{QT}, R\_{BT}) = \\frac{|{\\text{Doe, Suite 18}}|}{|{\\text{John, Doe, Suite 18, 18 555, 555 VPIN, VPIN DR, J., VPIN DRIVE, DRIVE Suite}}|} = \\frac{2}{9} \\approx 0.22$. *Correction based on your example:* If we consider "VPIN DR" and "VPIN DRIVE" as a match due to normalization/synonyms, and "18 555" and "555 VPIN" implicitly linked via "VPIN", then the tokens you provided {John, Doe, Suite 18, 18 555, 555 VPIN, VPIN DRIVE} and {J., Doe, VPIN DRIVE, DRIVE Suite, Suite 18} share:
          * "Doe"
          * "Suite 18"
          * "VPIN DRIVE" (assuming "VPIN DR" normalizes to "VPIN DRIVE" or vice versa).
            This gives 3 common tokens out of 6 (search) + 5 (record) - 3 (common) = 8 unique tokens. So, $J = \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375$. Your original calculation $3/5 = 60%$ implies a different set intersection or interpretation, potentially focusing on how many search tokens are *found* in the record's tokens rather than a strict Jaccard. Clarifying this interpretation is important. For instance, if the question is "what percentage of my search query tokens are found in the record," then your $3/5 = 60%$ is valid, representing recall from the search query perspective.

#### 3.4. Phase 4: Clustering (Entity Consolidation)

  * **Objective:** To group matched records into clusters, each representing a unique real-world entity.
  * **Methodology:**
      * **Transitive Closure:** If record A matches record B, and record B matches record C, then A, B, and C are grouped into the same cluster. This process forms connected components in a graph where nodes are records and edges represent matches.
      * **Aggregated Profile (Master Profile):** For each cluster, a "Master Profile" is generated. This consolidated profile combines and reconciles information from all records within the cluster, providing a clean, enriched, and comprehensive view of the identified entity. Data cleaning, de-duplication, and conflict resolution (e.g., choosing the most recent or most complete value for an attribute) are performed during this step.
  * **Categorization of Relationships:**
      * **'Who Is Who' (High Confidence Clusters):** Records with a high matching accuracy rate, particularly those sharing multiple unique identifiers (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses, precise street addresses), are grouped into "Who Is Who" clusters. These represent records very likely belonging to the same entity. The Master Profile is primarily derived from these clusters.
      * **'Who Knows Who' (Lower Confidence Links):** Records with weaker links or lower matching rates are clustered under "Who Knows Who." These suggest potential associations or indirect relationships rather than direct identity matches.
  * **Visual Representation:** The Entity Resolution module will generate intuitive graphical representations illustrating how records are linked within each category, aiding users in understanding complex relationships.

### 4\. Mathematical Foundations and Key Concepts

The "Relations" module fundamentally relies on principles from **information retrieval**, **computational linguistics**, and **statistical matching**.

  * **Tokenization:** The process of breaking down text into individual units (tokens).
      * **Unigram:** Single words (e.g., "John," "Doe").
      * **Bigram:** Sequences of two adjacent words (e.g., "Suite 18," "VPIN DR").
      * **N-gram:** Generalization to sequences of $n$ words. Bigrams are particularly valuable for addresses due to their ability to preserve word order and improve distinctiveness against data quality issues.
  * **Bag of Tokens (BoT):** A representation of text as an unordered multiset of its tokens. Used for calculating set-based similarities.
  * **Jaccard Index:** A statistical measure of similarity between two finite sample sets. For sets $A$ and $B$, $J(A, B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|}$. This quantifies the overlap between two sets of tokens.
  * **Probabilistic Matching:** Assigning a probability to the likelihood that two records refer to the same entity. This is often achieved through:
      * **Record Pair Weighting:** Assigning weights to different matching attributes (e.g., an exact phone number match has a higher weight than a fuzzy name match).
      * **Fellegi-Sunter Model:** A classical statistical framework for record linkage that estimates the probability of a match given observed agreements and disagreements between fields. While complex to implement fully, its principles of $m$-probabilities (probability of agreement given a match) and $u$-probabilities (probability of agreement given a non-match) underpin modern probabilistic ER.
  * **Graph Theory:** Utilized in the clustering phase, where records are nodes and detected matches are edges. Connected components in this graph represent clusters of records belonging to the same entity.
