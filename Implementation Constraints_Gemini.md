# AURORA Intelligence Platform  
## Case Builder/Creator Feature: Industry-Benchmark Functional Specification

## 1. Data Integration and Exploration

### Functional Summary

- **Upload & Integration:**
  - Officers can upload tabular (CSV, XLSX), unstructured (PDF, DOCX, EML), and media (image, audio, video) data.
  - All uploads require explicit setting of:
    - **`data_classification`** (`unclassified`, `confidential`, `secret`, `top_secret`)
    - **`storage_mode`** (`analysis_sandbox`, `case_evidence`, `intelligence_vault`, `collaborative_workspace`)

- **Role-Based Access & Enforcement:**
  - **Aurora Admin**: Unrestricted access (across all orgs, Top Secret data)
  - **Organization Admin**: Restricted to own org, up to Secret classification
  - **Regular User**: Restricted to own org/resources, up to Confidential
  - **Strict RLS (Row Level Security)** on all data queries and uploads: User only accesses/downloads/upload records for which they are explicitly cleared.

- **Dynamic UI/UX:**
  - All actions (view/search/upload/“add to case”) are dynamically enabled/disabled based on user role, classification, storage mode, and org boundary.
  - Classification and storage mode badges displayed for every record; UI prevents actions on records above user’s clearance.

- **Exploratory Search:**
  - Unified queries across system-uploaded and user-uploaded data, but results filtered/enforced by RBAC, classification, and storage mode (database → API → UI).

- **Ingestion & Mapping:**
  - User-friendly field mapping for structured uploads.
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract structured entities from unstructured data; user must possess requisite clearance for extracted items.

- **Storage Modes:**
  - `analysis_sandbox`: Personal, ephemeral (24h max)
  - `case_evidence`: Restricted to assigned case team members
  - `intelligence_vault`: Organization-wide sharing, scoped by classification and role
  - `collaborative_workspace`: Multi-agency/federated future mode

## 2. Case Initiation and Naming

### Functional Summary

- **Bulk Add from Search/Visualization:**
  - Multi-select (checkbox, Ctrl+click, or drag-select) from search results or network diagrams.
  - “Add to Existing Case” or “Create New Case with Selection” actions are only available for records within user’s clearance and purpose.

- **AI-Supported Naming and Summaries:**
  - On new-case initiation, AI-driven suggestions for name and description—seeded by selected records/entities, customizable logic by entity type.
  - All suggestions are editable and tracked.

- **Record Linking & Context:**
  - Every record retains:
    - Source module and file
    - Data classification and storage mode
    - Originating org
    - Full provenance

- **Case Creation Constraints:**
  - Enforcement of role/classification: User cannot include records beyond clearance/storage_mode (attempt = alert + audit).
  - Only case members (assigned via backend policy) gain access to case_evidence-linked records.

- **Metadata & Audit:**
  - Every initiation, addition, edit, and sharing is fully logged, including attempted or denied actions.

- **AI-Powered Suggestions:**
  - Related case matches, officer/collaborator recommendations, and relevant report/case templates—restricted to user’s clearance.

## 3. Collaboration & Access Control

### Functional Summary

- **RBAC and Classification Enforcement:**
  - **Three-tier roles** enforce not just record access, but also case collaboration features (edit, comment, assign, export).
  - **Real-time UI filtering and disabling** for features above user’s permitted scope.

- **Discussion, Messaging, and Co-Editing:**
  - Threaded comments, mentions, and message threads scoped by case assignment and data access (e.g., can’t see comments attached to data you aren’t cleared for).
  - Real-time collaborative editing for case notes/reports (within cleared content).
  - All communication, edits, and assignments are audit logged.

- **Case Team Controls & Storage Mode Boundaries:**
  - Case membership controls—full support in backend schema, partial in current UI (flagged for upgrade).
  - Storage mode and org boundaries strictly enforced: No data leakage across cases/orgs/storage modes.

- **Supervisor Approvals & Override:**
  - Workflow framework present for escalations; UI workflows in progress (approval for record unlock, case sharing, sensitive exports, etc.).
  - All overrides tracked in audit with justification required.

- **Notifications & Alerts:**
  - Configurable in-app and out-of-band notifications for all case/team operations.
  - Automated security alerts (e.g., suspicious access, cross-org attempts, bulk activity) with escalation workflow.

- **Future-Proofing:**
  - “Collaborative workspace” ready for true cross-org/federated use, with enhanced attribute-based and purpose-based controls designed, not yet fully implemented.

## 4. Investigative Tools Integration

### Functional Summary

- **Data/Classified-Restricted Relations:**
  - Entity resolution, “Who-Is-Who” and “Who-Knows-Who” analysis outputs are only visualized/sharable if user is cleared for **all** underlying data nodes.
  - Relation graphs never display classified links the user cannot access; org/storage_mode boundaries visually indicated.

- **Network Analysis Versioning & Auto-Update:**
  - Default: Saved analytic outputs auto-refresh with new data; user may “freeze” a version for reporting/evidentiary use.
  - Every update/version is immutable, fully audit logged, with UI indicator for new/changed contents.
  - Annotations/notes attempt to persist across updates; if not, migration UI and notification provided.

- **Tagging & Metadata:**
  - All outputs tagged with analysis type, source, primary entities, and operational tags.
  - Tagging and metadata integrate with global search/filter, always within access scope.

- **Audit and Chain of Custody:**
  - Every analytic, view, edit, export, annotation, and sharing action logged at fine-grained detail, including classification/storage_mode of all evidence.

- **Inter-agency/Federated Mode:**
  - Foundation baked into entity and visualization layers for federated/collaborative analysis—future expansion.

## 5. Notes, Reporting, and Export

### Functional Summary

- **Rich Notes & Annotation:**
  - Direct annotation over diagrams and maps; persistent overlay layers, versioned with main graph.
  - Notes can contain embedded images, media (small video/audio), document attachments.
  - Tagging: Both granular (section/paragraph) and general, with filter/search UI.
  - Embedded media carries metadata, supports in-platform playback and caption/transcript viewing (where available).

- **Reporting System:**
  - **Two-Tier Model:**  
    - **Official Reports:** Locked, legally-compliant templates (court admissible), enforced mandatory fields, digital signature, export watermarking, and full metadata attachment.
    - **Custom Reports:** User-defined layouts, narrative+structured, saved organization/team templates, full control for internal or intelligence dissemination.
  - **Export Options:** PDF, Word, secure HTML/ZIP (all cleared via user’s roles/classifications and audit logged).

- **Audit and Compliance:**
  - Every note, report, export, and transmission tracked; original data/source always referenced, chain-of-custody preserved.
  - UI disables export on content above user's scope.

## 6. Security and Audit

### Functional Summary

- **RBAC, Classification, and Storage Mode Grid:**
  - All actions—search, view, upload, add-to-case, export—enforced at every layer by the intersection of user role, data classification, storage mode, and org boundary.
  - Full cross-org/federated support is “future ready” in schema and APIs.

- **Case Locking:**
  - Lock (full/section/record) to freeze data from edits (post-case close, legal freeze, etc.), permissioned to admins/supervisors.
  - Visual indicators and audit trail for all lock/unlock events.

- **Supervisor Approval/Override:**
  - Approval framework established for sensitive data and actions (exports, sharing, deletion, etc.), with audit/log for justification, request, approval/reject.

- **Just-in-Time Access/Expiry:**
  - Temporary privilege escalation controlled by role, storage_mode, or approval; automatic expiry and revoke upon timeout or case status change.
  - Fully audit logged.

- **Audit Logging & Alerts:**
  - Immutable, tamper-proof audit tables; each action logs user/org, operation, context (case, record, method), IP, classification, risk score, and security context.
  - Real-time alerts for risky or anomalous actions (multiple rapid searches, cross-org attempts, bulk-downloads); routed to security dashboards.
  - Blockchain-ready audit signatures, no log deletion.

## 7. Law Enforcement & Compliance Alignment

- Complete chain of custody support for all evidence handling
- Only officers assigned on a case or via explicit storage_mode have access to data—fully enforced from DB to UI
- Meets/exceeds industry requirements for audit, access control, and classification handling
- System architecture ready for future cross-jurisdictional and multi-agency taskforce operations
