Here’s a comprehensive, role-specific documentation of all identified functionalities and features pertaining to the **Data Explorer**, **Relations**, and **Case Management** modules so far, incorporating both initial requirements and your detailed responses. This captures all conversations to date, ensuring no critical capability is overlooked. I will continue to track and refine this artifact as more details on additional modules (collaboration, security, etc.) are provided.

## Data Explorer Module

### 1. Data Integration and Upload
- **Accepts a wide range of data types and formats for upload:**
  - **Tabular:** CSV, XLSX (addresses, persons, phone numbers, etc.)
  - **Semi-structured:** JSON, XML
  - **Unstructured:** PDF, DOCX, TXT, PST/EML (email)
  - **Media:** JPG, PNG, TIFF, MP3, MP4, WAV (with OCR/audio-transcript integration)
- **User-assisted mapping interface**:
  - Upon upload of structured data, users map columns/fields to platform’s canonical data model (e.g., “Suspect_Name” → “Person.FullName”).
  - Templates for recurring mappings.
- **Schema-on-read / dynamic schema inference** for rapid analysis of new file structures.
- **Automated extraction from unstructured files** via NLP/NER for entities (people, organizations, locations).

### 2. Data Governance & Quality
- **Full data provenance:** All uploads tagged with uploader, timestamp, source, sensitivity, and lineage tracking.
- **Automated data quality checks:** Identify missing data, inconsistent formats, or obvious errors; flag issues for user review.

### 3. Exploratory Search and Case Initiation
- **Unified search**: Simultaneous querying over internal system data and user-uploaded data.
- **Actionable search results**:
  - “Create Case” button next to each record/row.
  - Bulk selection and addition of multiple records to a case.
- **Dynamic permissions-driven UI**:
  - 'Create Case' buttons/actions are only enabled for records the user is authorized to use, reflecting data sensitivity, user role, and access level in real-time.
  - Restricted records: Icon changes or greys out, informative alert on click, and potential supervisor override request.
- **Case naming**:
  - AI-powered suggestion engine creates default case titles/descriptions drawn from selected records.
  - Manual name override allowed.

## Relations Module

### 4. Entity Resolution and Network Analytics
- **Automated entity deduplication and linkage**:
  - Fuzzy matching (names, addresses, identifiers).
  - Probabilistic matching and system-suggested merges (with “human-in-the-loop” review for critical resolves).
- **Continuous operation**:
  - Runs on both internal and user-uploaded data.
  - Supports batch and incremental reconciliation.
- **Visual “Who-is-Who” and “Who-knows-Who”**:
  - Network diagrams and entity relationship charts integrated in the case workspace.
  - Options to save static versions or embed live, auto-updating relations snapshots in the case.
- **Data lineage/tagging**:
  - All entities and inferred links retain metadata regarding source, confidence, and edit history.

## Case Management Module (relevant to Data Integration scope)

### 5. Permissions and Data Sensitivity Controls
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - 'Create Case' and subsequent case interactions restricted by role (investigator, analyst, supervisor, etc.).
  - Data tiers: Unclassified, Law Enforcement Sensitive, Confidential, Restricted, etc.
  - User can only use records where their clearance/purpose matches record sensitivity.
- **Purpose-based and need-to-know restrictions**:
  - System supports purpose-driven access for certain sensitive records, linked to case justification.
- **Redaction and data masking tools**:
  - Automated/manual redaction before records can be added to a case, especially for PII or protected information.
- **Auditability**:
  - Every action (including viewing, attempting to create a case, and supervisor override) is logged with metadata.
  - Attempted access to restricted records triggers notifications, alerts, and workflow to escalate for approval if allowed.

### 6. Data Validity and Quality Warnings
- **“Low confidence”/“unverified” flagging** at import or during case creation.
- **User is warned (but not always blocked) when attempting to use questionable data.**

## Supporting Implementation Features (Cross-Module)

- **Ontology-driven canonical data model**: Standardizes how all data is represented and linked.
- **Provenance and metadata-driven record tracking**: Ensures data source, upload history, and sensitivity are retained and queryable.
- **Audit trail and logging**: Persistent, tamper-proof records of all data accesses, uploads, and case actions.

## Pending Further Clarification (Next Steps)

### **A. Multi-Select Case Population**
- **Bulk Actions/Selection:**
  - Officers can select *multiple* records/entities from search results using checkboxes.
  - Bulk actions menu appears (“Add to Case”, “Create New Case with Selected”).
- **Contextual Drag-and-Drop:**
  - (Ideal/maturity stage) Users may drag selected records/entities directly to a case builder panel or icon.
- **Selections in Visualizations:**
  - Within *Relations* or graph-based interfaces, officers can multi-select nodes (entities) or edges (relationships) to include in case creation/addition.

## 2. Case Management Module: Case Initiation & Naming

### **A. Case Creation Triggers**
- **Initiate case creation directly from:**
  - *Data Explorer* search results (single or multi-select)
  - *Relations* diagrams/networks (multi-node/edge select)
  - Contextual menu or drag-and-drop
- **Support for both:**
  - Creating a **new** case from selection
  - Adding to an **existing** case (user searches/filters accessible cases)

### **B. Case Naming and Description**
- **AI-Suggested Naming:**
  - On case initiation, AI analyzes selected ‘seed’ records/entities and generates a default:
    - **Case name**
    - **Brief summary/description** of likely investigative focus
  - Officer may freely override/edit any AI suggestion.
  - **Seed logic is customizable** per entity type (Person, Vehicle, Event, etc.)—admin/config-driven.
  - AI uses related attributes (e.g., subject name, address, event) to produce relevant labels.

### **C. Automatic Associations & Context**
- When multiple entities are added:
  - System runs initial entity resolution/network analysis on the set.
  - Flags/suggests initial intra-case links (associates, shared addresses, etc.) using underlying “Relations” technology.
  - Each record in the case maintains clear links to source (origin in Data Explorer or Relations module).

### **D. User Feedback**
- Visual indicators (e.g., count of selected records) and confirmation messages on successful addition.
- Warnings for any record that cannot be added (due to permissions/sensitivity), with reasons described (per previous Data Sensitivity requirements).

## 3. Case Management Module: AI-Enabled Intelligent Suggestions

### **A. Suggestions for Case Creation**

#### **1. AI-Guided Case Summaries/Descriptions**
- On *Create Case*, AI autofills:
  - Case name
  - Brief “case summary/description” (editable)
- Logic is transparent and administrators can configure “what to prioritize” in the summary (based on record/entity type, template, or rules).

#### **2. Discovery of Related Cases**
- AI suggests **existing cases** likely related to new case seed data:
  - Based on entity overlap, phone/address/event/date similarity, modus operandi, or geospatial proximity.
  - Display clearly: “Potential Related Cases” with matching criteria highlighted.
- User can view and link their new case with past/ongoing ones.

#### **3. Past Templates Recommendation**
- AI infers probable case type (e.g., “Homicide”, “Burglary”, “Fraud”) from selected data.
- Suggests applying **agency-defined** best-practice templates for the case structure/sections.
- User may accept, modify, or ignore the suggestion.

#### **4. Relevant Collaborators Suggestion**
- AI examines seed data, past workloads, case assignments, and expertise to suggest relevant colleagues, teams, or units as collaborators.
- Only suggests collaborators in line with access controls.
- Promotes institutional knowledge-sharing and faster, more accurate investigations.

### **B. Human-in-the-Loop Review**
- All AI-generated suggestions are *transparently presented* as “AI Suggestions.”
- Officers can review, accept, edit, or ignore these inputs.
- Ensures officers retain control and remain accountable for final structure/participants.

## 4. Cross-Module: Metadata & Provenance
- All entities, records, and case associations retain rich metadata (origin, source, uploader, upload time, sensitivity, etc.).
- Case creation logs maintain auditability for all actions (creation, addition/removal of records, use of AI suggestions, etc.).

## 5. UX/UI Implications

- Data Explorer and Relations interfaces must support intuitive multi-select and bulk action designs.
- “Create Case”/“Add to Case” are context-aware, supporting both individual and bulk actions.
- Case creation window guides officers through editable AI-driven naming, description, and suggestion review, reducing cognitive load.
- Suggestions for templates, collaborators, and related cases are dynamic panels—visibly marked as AI-driven and dismissable/editable by the user.

## 6. Pending/To Be Updated

- **Collaboration features, audit, security, reporting, etc.** will be appended as you provide further responses to the iterative benchmarks.

# Summary (For Prompt Engineering and LLM Codegen)

- Bulk, multi-record case initiation and editing are a must for efficiency.
- Case naming and summaries are always AI-suggested (editable by user) using customizable logic.
- At creation, the system provides proactive AI-powered recommendations: related cases, templates, and relevant collaborators—*all subject to user review (“human-in-the-loop” safeguard)*.

This will ensure nothing is lost, duplicated, or omitted as the product vision continues to evolve. Each feature below is fully cataloged and aligned with best practices seen in industry-leading platforms such as Palantir Gotham and IBM i2.

# AURORA Intelligence Platform: Consolidated Functional Requirements  
**Section: Investigative Tools Integration**  
*(Integrated with Data Explorer, Relations, Case Management, Collaboration, and previous modules)*

## 1. Relations & Network Analysis Integration

### A. Auto-Update of Network Analyses / Relation Graphs

- **Optional Auto-Update Mode**
  - Default for active/open cases: Saved relation/network analyses (e.g., entity graphs, “Who-Knows-Who” mappings) auto-refresh if new relevant data is ingested.
  - **User Control:** Officers can freeze/“lock” a specific version (“snapshot”) to prevent auto-updates for analytical or evidentiary purposes.
  - **Toggle per analysis:** Auto-update status (on/off) configurable per saved analysis, with clear UI controls.

- **Versioning and Auditability**
  - Every update (manual or auto) generates a new version, timestamped and tied to the officer or system-triggered event.
  - Officers can view version history, restore prior versions, or compare differences (diff).
  - Each version records: Who/what triggered, data source, and context (why updated).

- **Visual Indicators & UX Cues**
  - When an auto-update or new version is available: 
    - Visual cue/badge in the case workspace (e.g., alert icon, “New Data Available” banner).
    - Option to review “what’s changed” (new nodes/edges, modified relationships) before accepting updated view.
  - For material or disruptive changes, a confirmation prompt before replacing the officer’s current annotated view.

- **Data/Entity Lineage**
  - Every network node/edge carries clear provenance: source record(s), last update, chain of transformations.

## 2. Structured Tagging & Metadata for Notes/Analyses

### A. Automated System-Driven Tags

- **Source/Module Tags:** All content imported/copied from a module is auto-tagged by origin.
  - E.g., `Source: Relations Module`, `Source: Data Explorer`, `Type: Network Analysis`.
- **Analysis/Output Type Tags:** Tags such as `Analysis Type: Who-Is-Who`, `Analysis Type: Who-Knows-Who`, etc.
- **Entity/Relationship Tags:** Auto-attach entity IDs, names, and types when a note/result focuses on a specific entity or link.
  - E.g., `Primary Entity: Person - John Doe (ID: XYZ123)`, `Analysis Focus: Identity Confirmation`.
- **Temporal Metadata:** All notes/analyses carry their creation, last modification, and—if different—event date context (for retroactive analyses).

### B. User-Defined and AI-Suggested Tags

- **Manual/Free-Form Tagging:** Officers may append tags such as `Priority: High`, `Action: Follow-up`.
- **AI-Suggested Tags:** NLP and pattern recognition propose tags from content or a controlled vocabulary (agency-defined taxonomy).

### C. Capture as Structured Metadata vs. Flex-Tags

- **Structured Fields for Programmatic Search:**
  - Highly structured data (entities, relationships, analysis parameters, query terms) stored as dedicated metadata fields.
- **Flex-Tags for Thematic, Workflow, or Ad-Hoc Categorization:**
  - Flexible tagging for keywords, themes, or operational needs.

### D. Powerful Search, Filtering, and Navigation throughout Case Notes

- **Faceted search:** Filter by any tag, entity, analysis type, date range, contributor, or source module.
- **Batch selection or review:** For seeing all notes/analyses on a topic, or collating outputs for export/reporting.
- **Visual Labeling:** Color-coded or icon-based display of tags/metadata for at-a-glance comprehension.

## 3. Workflow, User Experience, and Controls

- **Case Notes Pane:** All analyses, queries, and network outputs can be added to the case notes with their tags/metadata attached.
- **Annotation & Highlight:** Officers can annotate a given snapshot or version of a network analysis; such annotations are bound to that specific version.
- **Searchable Knowledge Base:** Across all cases, the system forms an intelligent, machine-readable investigative archive—AURORA’s “institutional memory.”

## 4. AI-Augmented Analysis & Insights (Enabled by Structured Metadata)

- **Automated Summarization:** Summarize notes/analyses by tag, entity, or timeframe (e.g., “All ‘Who-Knows-Who’ notes for Suspect A in Q1 2025”).
- **Gap Analysis:** The system can detect investigative gaps, e.g., “No ‘Who-Is-Who’ analysis attached for key Person X.”
- **Next-Step Suggestions:** AI suggests follow-up actions based on patterns and tags, flagged in the notes panel.
- **Cross-Case Intelligence:** Tags and metadata support rapid linking to other cases with shared entities, patterns, or geographies.

## 5. Audit Logging and Provenance

- **Every creation, edit, update, or tagging event is fully audited for user, timestamp, source, old/new values, and case context.**
- **Preserves true chain-of-custody for every analytical output, annotation, or tag (crucial for evidentiary use and for robust compliance).**

## 6. Pending/Future Integration

- **All above features to be incorporated with existing Data Integration, Case Initiation, Collaboration & RBAC, and Reporting mechanisms.**
- **Any analytical or network outputs exported or shared externally will retain their tags, metadata, and provenance in exported files/reports.**

## Recap/Takeaways

- **Investigative Tools in AURORA are “live,” dynamic, and fully versioned—with user control over update cadence and rock-solid audit trail.**
- **Structured tagging and metadata transform case notes and outputs into a true, queryable intelligence graph for the agency.**
- **Every new feature integrates seamlessly with existing modules, maintaining usability, compliance, and cross-case analytical power.**

- **Layer Control:**
  - Annotations are maintained as a toggleable overlay layer, separate from the underlying visualization, for a clean/annotated view switch.
- **Persistency & Versioning:**
  - Annotations are saved with the diagram within case notes.
  - When the underlying diagram/network “version” changes (auto-updated or manually refreshed), the system attempts to persist/re-anchor relevant annotations.
  - If changes make persistence impossible, the system notifies the officer and allows for manual migration or archival of old annotated views.
- **Audit Trail:**
  - All annotation activity (create/edit/delete) is logged for compliance and accountability.

### B. Note Tagging (Structured & Searchable)
- **Automated Tagging:**
  - NLP suggests tags based on note content—detected entities, keywords, sentiment, operation type.

    - *Audit Trail:* All access grants, expiries, and related usage are logged, along with associated actions taken during the privilege window.

## 2. Multi-Org / Federated Case Management (Current and Future Design)

### A. Current State (Initial Release)
- **Default Scope:** Cases, data, and sharing are restricted within a single law enforcement agency’s users, roles, and access policies.
- **“Shared” Cases:** Within-org only, governed by that agency’s security and compliance settings.

### B. Future State: Multi-Organization/Federated Capabilities (Architectural Preparedness)
- **Inter-Agency Collaboration Use Cases:**
    - Joint task forces across local/state/federal/international agencies.
    - Secure cross-jurisdictional intelligence sharing (e.g., for cybercrime, drug/terrorism task forces).
- **Key Architectural & Functional Considerations:**
    - **Data Sovereignty:** Every agency retains strict data ownership/approval rights, even while sharing.
    - **Federated or Logically Partitioned Architecture:** Support either distributed (federated) or tightly segregated shared instances.
    - **Access Control Expansion:** From RBAC (roles) to ABAC (attribute-based, contextual/purpose-based), allowing fine-grained cross-agency controls.
    - **Digital MOUs** — System supports digital representation/enforcement of organization-to-organization information-sharing agreements (who, what, when, why, how).
    - **Deconfliction:** Tools to manage/alert on overlapping cases while minimizing detail exposure (e.g., “record X is being worked on elsewhere”).
    - **Granular/Layered Audit Logging:** Audit trails record internal vs. external/agreement-based access and distinguish origin, party, operation, and legal basis.
    - **Automated/Manual Redaction:** Content can be redacted/anonymized before cross-agency sharing, with templates and approval for release.
- **Platform Readiness:**
    - Core APIs, entity models, and metadata designed to support future federated extensions with minimal refactor.
    - All records, cases, and actions tagged with agency of origin and data classification for eventual federated querying and sharing policy.

## 3. Audit Trail and Compliance (Platform Wide)

- **Immutable, Tamper-Proof Audit Logging:** All user actions (view/add/edit/delete/export), authentication events, and sensitive operations (lock, approve, share, temporary access, etc.) are individually logged in a centralized, write-once log.
- **Event Granularity:** Captures who, what, when, where (including IP/device/source module), justification (where needed), old value, new value, and related workflow artifact (if applicable — e.g., approval ID, lock/unlock reason).
- **Log Retention & Search:** Configurable in line with local, state, federal, and agency-specific record-keeping regulations (e.g., logs kept for 7 years). Powerful querying/filtering/reporting tools for compliance teams.
- **Audit Review Tools:** UI for compliance officers/admins to review actions, process audit panels for supervisors.
- **Export, Print, and Chain-of-Custody:** Every external export (report, diagram, evidence packet) logs not only who exported but also links to the specific data/records, export settings (e.g., watermark, encryption), and destination (if known).

## 4. Security Features Recap & Integration

- **Fine-grained RBAC and future-ready ABAC.
- Role, section, record, and time-based permissions.
- Approval/lock workflows and just-in-time access for high-risk operations.
- Full, immutable, richly structured audit across every module, operation, and data export.
- Multi-org/federated sharing as a design-ready, phased roadmap feature with all supporting policy, audit, and compliance primitives anticipated.
- Seamless, consistent UI/UX for all security controls (locks, approvals, expired access, notifications), with real-time dashboarding for supervisors and compliance officers.

## 5. Integration with All Modules

All security and audit features above are:
- Enforced across Data Explorer, Relations, Case Management, Notes, Reporting, Export, and Collaboration features.
- Interlock with structured tagging, approvals, and audit at every creation, modification, export, or cross-agency sharing event.

# Summary for LLM Prompting/Development

**AURORA’s security and audit model moves far beyond basic user roles: every sensitive action is controlled through a layered combination of locking, approvals, time-bound access, and immutable logging. System architecture is future-proofed for cross-jurisdictional scalability and compliance from Day 1. All features are fully integrated, tracked, and auditable for the highest possible standards of law enforcement intelligence and case management.**
