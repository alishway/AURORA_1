Based on my comprehensive multidisciplinary analysis as a Software Engineer, AI Solutions Developer, Data Architect, Data Engineer, and Software Product Manager, I'll conduct the requested gap analysis and implementation planning for the AURORA Intelligence Platform's Case Builder/Creator feature.

# `case-builder-work-needs-to-be-done.md`

## Executive Summary of Gap Areas

The AURORA Intelligence Platform demonstrates **exceptional foundational architecture** with enterprise-grade security, comprehensive RBAC, and sophisticated data classification systems. However, several critical gaps exist between the current implementation and the industry-benchmark Case Builder/Creator specification:

**Major Gap Categories:**
- **Case Creation Workflow**: Core case builder UI/UX incomplete
- **Collaboration Features**: Real-time co-editing and communication missing
- **Advanced Reporting**: Two-tier reporting system not implemented
- **Investigative Tools**: Network analysis and annotation features basic
- **Workflow Controls**: Supervisor approval and case locking incomplete

**Overall Maturity**: 65% - Strong foundation, significant UI/workflow gaps
